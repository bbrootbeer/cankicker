well is there a "official" c++ crc8, since it's so common?

Great question! CRC8 is super common in embedded and communication protocols, but there isn’t a single “official” C++ standard CRC8 function built into the language or standard libraries. Instead, you typically:

Use a CRC8 implementation tailored to the specific polynomial your protocol uses (like 0x07, 0x31, 0xD5, etc).

Either write your own function (like the one you have), or

Use a well-tested CRC library.

Why is there no “official” CRC8?
CRC algorithms vary by polynomial, initial values, input/output reflection, final XOR value.

Different protocols use different CRC variants (e.g., CRC-8-CCITT, CRC-8-Dallas/Maxim, CRC-8-SAE J1850).

This variety means no one standard CRC8 fits all.

Common CRC8 variants & their polynomials
Name	Polynomial (hex)	Common Use
CRC-8	0x07	Many generic uses
CRC-8-SAE J1850	0x1D	Automotive
CRC-8-Dallas/Maxim	0x31	Dallas 1-wire devices
CRC-8-CCITT	0x07	Telecommunications

How to find or generate CRC8 code easily
Use online CRC code generators (like crccalc.com) — they generate C/C++ code for your polynomial and settings.

Use well-known libraries like:

Boost.CRC (a header-only C++ library in Boost for CRCs, but you need Boost installed)

Lightweight embedded libraries like tinycrc or crc8

Example of a very simple CRC8 function (your 0x07 poly):
Your existing function is typical and pretty standard:

cpp
Copy
Edit
uint8_t crc8(const uint8_t *data, uint8_t len) {
    uint8_t crc = 0x00; // init value
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        crc ^= data[i];  // XOR with next byte
        for (uint8_t j = 0; j < 8; j++) { // process 8 bits
            if (crc & 0x80)
                crc = (crc << 1) ^ 0x07;  // poly 0x07
            else
                crc <<= 1;
        }
    }
    return crc;
}
TL;DR:
No official “standard” in C++, but your implementation is solid and widely used.

Pick the polynomial matching your protocol.

Consider libraries for advanced needs.

Online generators can create optimized variants.

If you want, I can help you generate a CRC8 function for a different polynomial or show you how to optimize your current function with a lookup table. Would you like that?
